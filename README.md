# C-Security-System-Project---Capstone
C++ II Course Project, simple OOP Security system design


This project will be updated as my course completes here in the next few weeks. Future updates will include all the CPP files alone with the explanded methods/interface design. Project goals are to create a simple security system that shows compentancies in OOP, industry standards with documentation and format, pointers, STL libraries, and etc. 

Please let me know if there are any questions on the project or feel free to comment with any suggestions. 

Thank you!
